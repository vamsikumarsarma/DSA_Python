Strings are collection of sequence of characters

They can be created with single qutoes double quotes and thriple quotes
a ='helllo'
b = "world"
c = """Hello, 
        world"""
In general single quotes are used for regex matching
Thriple quotes for spanning the multi line Strings

# defining strings in Python
# all of the following are equivalent
my_string = 'Hello'
print(my_string) Hello

my_string = "Hello"
print(my_string) Hello

my_string = '''Hello'''
print(my_string) Hello

# triple quotes string can extend multiple lines
my_string = """Hello, welcome to
           the world of Python"""
print(my_string) Hello, welcome to 
                    the world of python


String Accessing
----------------
s#Accessing string characters in Python
str = 'programiz'
print('str = ', str) str = programiz

#first character
print('str[0] = ', str[0]) str[0] = p

#last character
print('str[-1] = ', str[-1]) str[-1] = z

#slicing 2nd to 5th character
print('str[1:5] = ', str[1:5])  str[1:5] = rogr

#slicing 6th to 2nd last character
print('str[5:-2] = ', str[5:-2]) str[5:-2] = am


String Error--> Strings are immutable, which means elements of a string cannot be changed but, the total string can be re-assigned.
-----------
>>> my_string = 'programiz'
>>> my_string[5] = 'a'
...
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

# Python String Operations
str1 = 'Hello'
str2 ='World!'

str1 + str2 =  HelloWorld!
str1 * 3 = HelloHelloHello

# Iterating through a string
count = 0
for letter in 'Hello World':
    if(letter == 'l'):
        count += 1
print(count,'letters found')

3 letters found

>>> 'a' in 'program'
True
>>> 'at' not in 'battle'
False
